Here are some more things we need to stop doing immediately in data:

- **Loading entire datasets into memory when it’s not necessary** → Learn how to use chunking, streaming, or databases properly instead of slamming a `.csv` into Pandas.  
- **Overengineering ETL pipelines for simple tasks** → Not everything needs Airflow or Kafka. Sometimes, a well-structured SQL query or a simple script is enough.  
- **Using Excel as a database** → If your workflow involves multiple VLOOKUPs and pivot tables on a 500MB file, it's time to move to a real database.  
- **Ignoring SQL performance optimization** → Stop writing SELECT * everywhere. Learn indexing, partitioning, and query optimization instead of blaming the database.  
- **Using JSON fields in SQL databases as a crutch** → If you’re constantly extracting fields from JSON columns in Postgres, you might just need a better schema.  
- **Not version-controlling data transformations** → If your data pipeline lives in someone’s local Jupyter notebook, congratulations, you’ve created a single point of failure.  
- **Not documenting anything** → "The data team knows how it works" is not documentation.  
- **Using row-based processing when vectorized operations exist** → If you’re iterating over rows in Pandas instead of using `.apply()`, you need an intervention.  
- **Ignoring nulls and data integrity issues until it's too late** → Garbage in, garbage out. Validate your data at the source before it becomes a nightmare downstream.  
- **Thinking "we'll fix it in the dashboard"** → Fix it in the pipeline, the transformation layer, or the source—not in a last-minute BI tool hack.  
- **Overcomplicating machine learning models when a simple heuristic works** → If a rule-based filter solves 90% of the problem, you don’t need a neural network.
