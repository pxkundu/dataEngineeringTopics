### **Prerequisites**
1. **Software Requirements**:
   - R (version 4.0 or above).
   - RStudio (recommended for ease of use).

2. **Dataset**:
   - Place `Dataset.csv` in the working directory.

3. **R Packages**:
   Ensure the following R packages are installed:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "readxl", "corrplot", "tidyverse", 
                      "GGally", "arules", "rpart", "wordcloud", "tm", 
                      "forecast", "arulesViz", "tidytext", "textdata"))
   ```

4. **Working Directory**:
   - Update the working directory in `finalCode.R`:
     ```r
     setwd("C:/path/to/your/dataset")
     ```

---

### **Steps to Run the Project**
1. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Install R and required libraries.
   - Place `finalDataset.csv` in the specified directory.

2. **Run the Code**:
   - Open `finalCode.R` in RStudio.
   - Execute the code step by step.

3. **Sections of the Code**:
   - **Data Loading**: Reads and summarizes the dataset.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Includes correlation heatmaps, histograms, and pair plots.
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses `tidytext` and Bing sentiment lexicon for scoring reviews.
   - **Association Rules**: Generates rules using the Apriori algorithm for product categories.
   - **Regression Models**: Applies linear, logistic, and decision tree models to analyze promotions.
   - **Time Series Forecasting**: Forecasts purchases using ARIMA.
   - **Word Cloud**: Visualizes frequent words in customer reviews.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Histograms of numeric variables.
   - Correlation heatmaps.
   - Sentiment score distribution plots.
   - Word clouds for positive and negative sentiments.

### **Expected Outputs**
1. **EDA Insights**:
   - Distribution of variables like `Purchase`, `Satisfaction Score`, and `Discount Percentage`.
   - Correlation heatmap showing relationships between features.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Sentiment trends across customer reviews.
   - Visualization: Positive/Negative word cloud.

3. **Association Rules**:
   - Top 10 product-category associations based on customer interactions.

4. **Regression Models**:
   - Linear regression insights on purchase behavior.
   - Logistic regression to predict promotion effectiveness.
   - Decision tree models for targeted recommendations.

5. **Time Series Forecast**:
   - Predicted purchase trends for the next 12 months.

6. **Visualizations**:
   - Interactive plots for customer sentiment and satisfaction trends.

---

### **Potential Issues and Solutions**
1. **Dataset Not Found**:
   - Ensure `finalDataset.csv` is in the correct working directory.

2. **Missing Values**:
   - Code handles missing values, but verify data quality before execution:
     ```r
     missing_values <- colSums(is.na(final_dataset))
     print(missing_values)
     ```

3. **Package Installation**:
   - Reinstall any missing packages with:
     ```r
     install.packages("package_name")
     ```

4. **Large Dataset Memory Issues**:
   - Use a system with sufficient RAM to handle 55,000 records.

### **Outcome**
This project provides actionable insights into customer sentiment and behavior, helping businesses:
- Optimize promotions for high-sentiment products.
- Re-engage neutral/negative sentiment customers.
- Build targeted strategies to enhance ROI and customer satisfaction.
