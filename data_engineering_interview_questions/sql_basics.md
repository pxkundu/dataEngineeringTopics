### **SQL Basics to Prepare for the SQL Reporting Developer's Interview**

Questions focused on **SQL queries, reporting, data modeling, performance tuning, and optimization**. Below is a **structured SQL preparation guide** covering **all key areas** relevant to this interview.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ 1. SQL Querying Basics**
âœ… **SELECT Statement & Filtering Data**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, email 
FROM customers 
WHERE country = 'Germany';
```
âœ” **Practice:**
- `SELECT DISTINCT` (removes duplicates).
- `ORDER BY` (sorting results).
- `LIMIT` / `TOP` (restricting results).

---

## **ðŸ”¹ 2. Joins & Relationships**
âœ… **Types of Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)**
```sql
SELECT customers.first_name, orders.order_id, orders.amount 
FROM customers 
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```
âœ” **Know when to use:**  
- **INNER JOIN** â†’ Matches records in both tables.  
- **LEFT JOIN** â†’ Returns all records from the left table + matching records from the right.  
- **RIGHT JOIN** â†’ Opposite of LEFT JOIN.  
- **FULL JOIN** â†’ Returns all records from both tables.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ 3. Aggregate Functions & Grouping**
âœ… **SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 5000;
```
âœ” **GROUP BY** â†’ Groups data by a column.  
âœ” **HAVING** â†’ Filters grouped data (similar to WHERE but for aggregates).  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ 4. Subqueries & CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**
âœ… **Subqueries (Nested Queries)**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE amount > 1000);
```
âœ… **CTEs for Readability & Reusability**
```sql
WITH CustomerOrders AS (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent 
    FROM orders 
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT * FROM CustomerOrders WHERE total_spent > 5000;
```
âœ” **CTEs vs. Subqueries** â†’ CTEs are better for **complex queries & reusability**.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ 5. Window Functions (Advanced SQL)**
âœ… **ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, order_id, amount,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY amount DESC) AS rank
FROM orders;
```
âœ” **PARTITION BY** â†’ Groups rows before ranking.  
âœ” **ORDER BY** â†’ Defines ranking order.  

âœ… **Cumulative Sum Example**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, order_date, amount,
       SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM orders;
```
âœ” **Useful for Reporting & Dashboards**.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ 6. SQL Performance Optimization**
âœ… **Indexing**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_email ON customers(email);
```
âœ” **Speeds up searches (`WHERE` and `JOIN` conditions).**  
âœ” **Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Indexes**.

âœ… **Query Execution Plan**
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 1001;
```
âœ” Helps identify **slow queries** and **indexing needs**.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ 7. SQL Reporting & Data Visualization**
âœ… **Stored Procedures for Reporting**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetTopCustomers
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
    ORDER BY total_spent DESC
    LIMIT 10;
END;
```
âœ” Used in **SSRS, Power BI, SAP BOBJ Reports**.

âœ… **Dynamic SQL for Reporting**
```sql
DECLARE @Country NVARCHAR(50) = 'USA';

EXEC sp_executesql N'
    SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name 
    FROM customers WHERE country = @Country', N'@Country NVARCHAR(50)', @Country;
```
âœ” **Dynamic queries based on user input**.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ 8. Data Warehousing & Reporting Concepts**
âœ… **Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema**
âœ” **Star Schema:** Simple, fewer joins, better for reporting.  
âœ” **Snowflake Schema:** More normalized, reduces redundancy.

âœ… **ETL Process**
âœ” **Extract â†’ Transform â†’ Load** steps for data warehousing.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ 9. Handling Date & Time in SQL**
âœ… **Date Functions**
```sql
SELECT GETDATE(); -- Current date & time
SELECT DATEADD(DAY, 7, GETDATE()); -- Adds 7 days
SELECT DATEDIFF(YEAR, '2000-01-01', GETDATE()); -- Difference in years
```
âœ” Used for **time-based reporting**.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ 10. Error Handling in SQL**
âœ… **Using TRY...CATCH for Error Handling**
```sql
BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com');
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
```
âœ” Handles **runtime errors in stored procedures**.
